# MIPS-fl-pt-arith
IEEE-754 floating point addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division code written in MIPS Assembly for UCSB CMPSC 154, Computer Architecture.  I believe it is safe to upload because the professor said he would not give this assignment again next year, as many of his students said it was too difficult.  I ran this code with QtSpim.
