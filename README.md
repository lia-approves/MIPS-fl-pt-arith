# MIPS-fl-pt-arith
IEEE-754 floating point addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division code written in MIPS Assembly for UCSB CMPSC 154.  I believe it is safe to upload because the professor said he would not give this assignment again next year after hearing many of his students tell him that it was too difficult.  I ran this code with QtSpim.
